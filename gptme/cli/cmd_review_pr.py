"""``gptme-util review pr`` — AI reviewer for GitHub PRs.

Stage 1 of the unified review pipeline (gptme#3442):

    gptme-util review pr 1234 --repo owner/repo  # produce a ReviewArtifact
    gptme-util review pr 1234 --save artifact.json  # save for review-watch

The command fetches the PR diff, spawns a gptme session to review it, and
emits a :class:`~gptme.util.review.ReviewArtifact` JSON on stdout (or saved
to ``--save`` path).  The artifact can then be passed to ``review-watch``::

    gptme-util review pr 1234 --save artifact.json
    gptme-util review watch --artifact artifact.json

Local / offline mode
--------------------
When ``--diff`` is given, ``gh`` is not required.  The diff is read from the
given path (``-`` for stdin) and PR metadata is inferred from ``--repo`` and
the positional PR argument (both required in this mode).

Security note
-------------
The gptme session that performs the review is given the PR diff as input.
Diff content is data being inspected, not trusted instructions — but a
malicious diff could attempt prompt-injection.  The review prompt includes
an explicit ``SECURITY`` notice to the model instructing it to treat all
diff content as data, never as commands.

Because that input is untrusted, the reviewer's toolset is a security
control, not a convenience knob.  It is selected from a closed set of named
presets (:data:`REVIEW_TOOL_PRESETS`), never from a free-form tool list:

``none`` (default)
    No tools.  The model sees the diff and nothing else.  This is what every
    existing caller gets; the default does not change.
``read-only`` (``--tool-preset read-only``)
    Adds the ``read`` tool, so the reviewer can open files in the checkout it
    runs from instead of reconstructing source from a diff hunk.  Read-only
    means read-only: no shell, no ``python``, no ``save``/``patch``, no
    browser.

Execution — running the PR's code, even sandboxed — is deliberately NOT
offered here and must not become reachable by adding a preset without a
separate security review.

Checkout provenance
-------------------
A file-reading preset is only sound if the working directory is a checkout of
the PR head.  Reading real file contents *from the wrong revision* is worse
than the misquoting the ``read`` tool exists to prevent: a misquote can be
caught downstream (the quoted text is absent from the file at the review SHA),
whereas a wrong-revision read produces a quote that genuinely matches the file
it came from and passes every such check.  Reviewing PR head ``abc123`` from a
checkout sitting on ``master`` yields findings about ``master``, attributed to
the PR.

So the precondition is checked, not merely documented: when the preset grants
file reads, ``git rev-parse HEAD`` in the working directory must equal the PR
head commit or the command refuses (see :func:`_verify_review_checkout`).
``--allow-checkout-mismatch`` overrides, downgrading the refusal to a loud
warning.  The default preset (``none``) never touches git.

# TRUST BOUNDARY
# --------------
# The reviewer session consumes UNTRUSTED input: a diff, a PR title and a PR
# body, all authored by whoever opened the pull request.  Any tool granted to
# that session is therefore a tool an attacker gets to aim, via prompt
# injection, at the machine running the review.
#
# Presets are an explicit, closed set — not a pass-through for arbitrary
# ``--tools`` strings — so that granting execution to a reviewer cannot happen
# by typo, by config drift, or by a caller forwarding user input.  Adding a
# preset that can execute code, write files, or reach the network for writes is
# a deliberate security decision and is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE here.
#
# Deliberately NOT derived from the ``hint:read-only`` tool hint: MCP tools
# self-declare that hint from server-supplied annotations
# (``gptme/tools/mcp_adapter.py``), so a hint-based preset would let a third
# party widen the reviewer's authority.  The names below are static.
#
# ``none`` is the default and reproduces the historical behaviour exactly.

#: Name of the core tool that lets the reviewer open files.  Single source of
#: truth: the presets below grant it, and :func:`_preset_grants_file_reads`
#: detects it.  Renaming the tool moves the grant and everything conditioned on
#: the grant (prompt section, checkout verification) together, instead of
#: silently keeping the grant while dropping the guards.
