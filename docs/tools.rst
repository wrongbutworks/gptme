Subagent Isolation Contract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When spawning a subagent you need to know exactly what it inherits from the parent
and what it starts fresh. There are four dimensions:

**1. Workspace config loading**

*Thread mode* (default, ``use_subprocess=False``):
  The subagent inherits the parent's *already-assembled* workspace context —
  the ``[prompt] files`` from ``gptme.toml`` and the ``context_cmd`` output as
  they were loaded for the parent session. It does **not** re-read from the
  subagent's working directory, so a subdirectory with its own ``gptme.toml``
  will not be picked up automatically.

*Subprocess mode* (``use_subprocess=True``):
  Spawns a fresh ``gptme`` process with ``workdir`` as the CWD, which naturally
  loads that directory's ``gptme.toml``. Use this when you want subagents to pick
  up directory-local workspace config.

Fine-grained control:

- ``context_mode="selective"`` + ``context_include`` — share only specific components
  (``"agent"``, ``"tools"``, ``"workspace"``) instead of the full workspace.

  Behavior by mode:

  **Thread**: fully supported — filters the inherited context to the specified components.

  **Subprocess**: ``context_mode`` is ignored (the child loads its own workspace from
  ``gptme.toml``); ``context_include=["workspace"]`` maps to the ``--context files``
  CLI flag to include workspace files. Other ``context_include`` values are ignored in
  this mode.

  **ACP**: both parameters are ignored.

- ``context_window=N`` — limit how many inherited context messages are forwarded
  (``0`` = none, ``None`` = all). Thread mode only; ignored in subprocess and ACP.

- ``context_turns=N`` — forward the last N turns of the parent conversation.
  Thread mode only; ignored in subprocess and ACP.

**2. Tool and state inheritance**

By default the subagent starts with the same tool list as the parent (both threads
share the same initial snapshot; contextvars are thread-isolated so the parent's
tool state cannot be mutated by the subagent).

Three ways to restrict tools:

- ``profile="explorer"`` (or any built-in profile) — applies a tool allowlist at spawn
  time. Built-in profiles: ``explorer`` (read-only), ``researcher``, ``developer``
  (full), ``verifier`` (read-only). Note: ``role="verify"`` forces
  ``use_subprocess=True`` and ``isolated=True`` in addition to the verifier profile.

- ``isolated=True`` — runs the subagent in a git worktree so filesystem writes don't
  affect the parent repo. The worktree is auto-cleaned after completion.

- ``redact_secrets=True`` (default) — scrubs common secret patterns (API keys, tokens,
  passwords) from workspace context messages before they reach the subagent.
  Thread-mode only; has no effect in subprocess or ACP modes (the child process's
  own ``gptme.toml`` controls its secret handling).

Signal tools are loaded regardless of allowlist so the subagent can communicate
back. Thread-mode subagents get ``complete``, ``clarify``, and ``progress``.
Subprocess subagents get ``complete`` and ``clarify``; ``progress`` is not loaded
because it depends on the parent's in-process notification queue.

**3. Cancellation and timeout**

- ``max_time`` (seconds) — a watchdog timer that marks the subagent result as
  ``"timeout"`` after the specified duration and delivers a timeout status
  notification. In subprocess mode the child process is terminated. In thread
  mode the background thread is not force-stopped; callers see the cached timeout
  result immediately while the thread continues until it finishes naturally.

- ``timeout`` (default 1800 s) — subprocess monitor kills the child process after
  this many seconds. Only applies in subprocess mode.

- The parent does not block waiting for subagents. Completion is delivered via the
  ``LOOP_CONTINUE`` hook, which re-enters the parent's loop with a notification
  message.

**4. Child transcript and result delivery**

Subagents always start with a **fresh conversation** — they do not inherit the parent's
message history by default. The result/transcript lifecycle:

- ``context_turns=N`` — the parent's last N turns are prepended to the subagent's
  conversation as context.

- On completion the subagent calls the ``complete`` signal tool with a summary; this
  is queued back to the parent via the ``LOOP_CONTINUE`` hook.

- ``subagent_read_log(agent_id)`` — retrieve the full child transcript from the parent
  after the subagent completes.

- ``subagent_status(agent_id)`` — poll completion/error state without waiting.

Fan-out and Parallel Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two helpers make it easy to run multiple independent tasks concurrently:

``subagent_parallel(tasks, ...)``
  Fan out N subagents in parallel and block until all complete. Returns results
  in the same order as the input tasks. Wall-clock time is bounded by the
  slowest agent, not their sum. Use this for straightforward parallel delegation
  where the parent needs all results before continuing::

      results = subagent_parallel([
          ("researcher", "Research async Python frameworks"),
          ("coder",      "Implement a basic async HTTP client"),
          ("tester",     "Write pytest tests for an async HTTP client"),
      ])

  Key parameters: ``isolated=True`` (each agent gets its own git worktree),
  ``output_schema`` (structured output — see below), ``model``, ``profile``,
  ``context_turns``, ``workdir``.

``subagent_batch(tasks, ...)``
  Non-blocking variant. Launches all subagents and returns a ``BatchJob``
  object immediately so the parent can continue working while agents run.
  Call ``job.wait_all()`` later to collect results. Useful when the parent
  has its own work to interleave::

      job = subagent_batch([
          ("a", "..."),
          ("b", "..."),
      ])
      # ... parent does other work ...
      results = job.wait_all()

``subagent_pipeline(items, *stages, ...)``
  Staged fan-out **without a barrier** between stages. Each item is processed
  through all stages in order, but items at different stages run concurrently —
  item A advances to stage 2 as soon as its stage-1 subagent completes, while
  item B may still be in stage 1. Wall-clock time is bounded by the slowest
  single-item chain, not the sum of the slowest per stage.

  This is more efficient than repeated ``subagent_parallel()`` calls (which add
  a full synchronisation barrier between stages) when items are independent.
  Each stage is a callable ``stage(item_prompt, prev_result) -> next_prompt``::

      items = [("auth", "Review auth.py"), ("db", "Review db.py")]
      results = subagent_pipeline(
          items,
          # Stage 0: review
          lambda item, _: f"Find bugs in this file: {item}",
          # Stage 1: verify — runs on auth while db is still in stage 0
          lambda item, prev: f"Adversarially verify these findings:\n{prev}",
      )
      # results[i][j] — result for item i at stage j
      for (prefix, _), stage_results in zip(items, results):
          print(f"{prefix}: {stage_results[-1]['result'][:80]}")

  Set ``isolated=True`` so concurrent file-editing subagents each get their own
  git worktree.

``subagent_wait_any(agent_ids, ...)``
  Return the first of the given subagents to complete. Useful for
  **speculative / hedging patterns**: spawn N subagents racing on the same
  task and take whichever finishes first, then cancel the rest::

      subagent("fast",     "Quick attempt at task X")
      subagent("thorough", "Thorough attempt at task X")
      first_id, result = subagent_wait_any(["fast", "thorough"], timeout=120)
      print(f"{first_id} won: {result['status']}")
      for aid in ("fast", "thorough"):
          if aid != first_id:
              subagent_cancel(aid)

  ``agent_ids`` is the list of IDs to wait on. Raises ``TimeoutError`` if no
  agent completes within ``timeout`` seconds (default 300).

Structured Output (output_schema)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both ``subagent_parallel()`` and ``subagent_batch()`` accept an
``output_schema`` parameter (a Pydantic model class). When set, each subagent
is instructed to return valid JSON matching the schema inside its ``complete``
block. Results are automatically parsed and validated — the ``"result"`` value
in each result dict is the parsed/validated object rather than a raw string::

    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class AnalysisResult(BaseModel):
        summary: str
        score: int
        issues: list[str]

    results = subagent_parallel(
        [("a1", "Analyze module A"), ("a2", "Analyze module B")],
        output_schema=AnalysisResult,
    )
    for r in results:
        if r["status"] == "success":
            analysis = r["result"]  # already a validated dict
            print(f"Score: {analysis['score']}")

The ``output_schema`` parameter is also available on the low-level
``subagent()`` call for single-agent structured output.

Token Budget Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``subagent_wait()`` and ``BatchJob.wait_all()`` include token usage in their
result dicts:

.. code-block:: python

    result = subagent_wait("my-agent")
    # result["input_tokens"]  — tokens consumed by the subagent's prompts
    # result["output_tokens"] — tokens generated by the subagent

This lets the parent track cumulative cost across a fleet of delegated tasks
and gate further spawning when a budget limit is reached.

Browser FAQ
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Does the browser tool bypass CAPTCHAs?**

No. The Playwright backend is a real browser engine (headless Chromium or Firefox),
so it behaves the same as any headless browser — some CAPTCHAs will block it.
gptme does not currently expose a headed-mode toggle for the built-in Playwright
launcher. To improve success on sites that detect headless Chromium, try Firefox:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipx run playwright==$PW_VERSION install firefox
    export GPTME_BROWSER_ENGINE=firefox

You can also connect to an existing Chromium-compatible browser over Chrome
DevTools Protocol:

.. code-block:: bash

    chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222
    export GPTME_BROWSER_CDP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9222

**Can I use a full GUI browser with extensions?**

Yes — via the :doc:`howto/computer-use` Docker image, which runs a real Chromium
browser inside a VNC-accessible desktop. Extensions, GUI interaction, and anything
that needs a visible browser window all work there. See the Computer tool and
:doc:`howto/computer-use` for setup details.

**Can I run the browser tool inside Docker?**

The standard Playwright backend works in Docker (headless mode, no display
required). For headed/GUI mode inside Docker, use the computer-use Docker image
which bundles a VNC server and a full desktop environment. See
:doc:`howto/computer-use` for details.

**The page is blocking my scrape — what should I try?**

In order:

1. Switch backends: ``GPTME_BROWSER_ENGINE=firefox`` (different fingerprint than
   Chromium)

2. Connect to an existing Chromium browser:
   ``GPTME_BROWSER_CDP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9222``

3. Use Anthropic native search (Claude models only):
   ``GPTME_ANTHROPIC_WEB_SEARCH=true``

4. Use the Computer tool with the VNC Docker image for full GUI browser control

.. _tool-allowlist:

Tool Selection & Allowlists
----------------------------

By default gptme loads its full built-in toolset. You can restrict which tools
are active for a given run — either to reduce the agent's surface area or to
build read-only / sandboxed profiles.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Pass a comma-separated list of tool names to ``--tools`` (CLI) or set the
``TOOL_ALLOWLIST`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Exact names — only these tools are loaded
    gptme --tools save,patch,shell,python "refactor this file"

    # Additive: start from defaults and add more
    gptme --tools +rag,browser "research this topic"

    # Subtractive: start from defaults and remove specific tools
    gptme --tools -shell,computer "safer mode"

    # Disable all tools (pure conversation)
    gptme --tools "" "just talk to me"

    # Strict audit mode: only the built-in read tool, no writes or execution
    gptme --tools read-only "summarise this repo"

Glob patterns (``*``, ``?``, ``[...]``) are also supported, matched against tool
names with :func:`fnmatch.fnmatchcase`.

``read-only`` is a named preset, not a hint pattern. It expands to the built-in
``read`` tool only, and cannot be combined with other tool names. This makes it
safe for auditing untrusted workspaces where ``shell``, ``ipython``, ``save``,
``append`` and ``patch`` must stay unavailable. Use ``hint:read-only`` only when
you explicitly want to trust third-party tool annotations, such as MCP server
metadata.

.. _hint-allowlist:

Hint-based patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tools can carry **capability hints** — semantic tags that describe what a tool
does. Hint-based allowlist entries let you match entire categories of tools at
once using the ``hint:`` prefix:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Allow only tools annotated as read-only
    gptme --tools "hint:read-only" "summarise this repo"

    # Mix exact names with hint patterns
    gptme --tools "shell,patch,hint:read-only" "analyse and fix"

The following hints are defined:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Hint
     - Meaning
   * - ``read-only``
     - Tool only reads state; never writes, creates, or deletes.
   * - ``destructive``
     - Tool may modify or delete state. Use with caution in automated runs.
   * - ``idempotent``
     - Tool is safe to call multiple times with the same arguments.
   * - ``closed-world``
     - Tool affects only local state; it does not make network requests or
       reach outside the current environment.

.. note::

    The built-in ``read`` tool carries the ``read-only`` hint. MCP tools can also
    carry the hint through server-supplied annotations (see below), so
    ``hint:read-only`` is broader than the strict ``read-only`` preset.

MCP tool annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When gptme connects to an MCP server, each tool's
`ToolAnnotations <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#tool-annotations>`_
are mapped to gptme hints:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 30 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - MCP annotation
     - Value
     - gptme hint
   * - ``readOnlyHint``
     - ``true``
     - ``read-only``
   * - ``destructiveHint``
     - ``true`` (and not read-only)
     - ``destructive``
   * - ``idempotentHint``
     - ``true``
     - ``idempotent``
   * - ``openWorldHint``
     - ``false``
     - ``closed-world``

Example MCP server configuration that exposes a read-only filesystem tool:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "name": "my-tools",
      "description": "My safe read-only tools",
      "tools": [
        {
          "name": "read_file",
          "description": "Read a file from disk",
          "annotations": {
            "readOnlyHint": true,
            "idempotentHint": true
          }
        }
      ]
    }

Once connected, ``gptme --tools "hint:read-only"`` will include ``read_file``
while excluding any MCP tools without the ``read-only`` annotation.

Example profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Read-only research agent** — cannot write files or run commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --tools "browser,rag,chats,hint:read-only" "research X"

**Minimal coding agent** — file editing only, no shell or browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --tools "read,save,patch,morph,python" "refactor this module"

**Safe MCP integration** — built-in defaults plus only read-only MCP tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --tools "+hint:read-only" "help me explore this codebase"

**Subagent with restricted tool set** — useful in ``[agent]`` config or when
spawning subagents programmatically:

.. code-block:: toml

    # gptme.toml
    [env]
    TOOL_ALLOWLIST = "shell,patch,save,read,hint:read-only"
